<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This is my first attempt at writing an angular component! To achive the given look and feel I have done the following steps</p>
<ol>
  <li>Removed all contents of app.component.html</li>
  <li>Created a basic template which is representing this view</li>
  <li>Added styles in app.component.css : (these styles are applicable to this component only</li>
  <li>To achieve a background color of the page :(global colour) I modified the styles.css </li>
</ol>
